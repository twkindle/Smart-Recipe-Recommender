# Smart Recipe Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that recommends personalized recipes to users based on their dietary preferences, ingredient availability, and nutritional requirements.

## Background

*The problem: Many people struggle with meal planning and finding recipes that suit their dietary needs and ingredient availability.

*Commonness: This problem is widespread, as individuals often face challenges in finding recipes that align with their specific preferences and requirements.

*Motivation: The motivation behind this project is to simplify the process of recipe discovery, promote healthy eating habits, reduce food waste, and provide tailored recommendations to users.


## How is it used?

*Context: The Smart Recipe Recommender can be utilized through a mobile app or a web interface.

*Users: This solution is designed for individuals who are seeking recipe recommendations tailored to their dietary preferences and ingredient availability.

*People affected: Users who struggle with meal planning, want to explore new recipes, or need assistance in finding suitable recipes based on their dietary restrictions.

## Data sources and AI methods

*Data sources: The project relies on a recipe dataset that includes information such as ingredients, nutritional values, cooking instructions, and user preferences.

*AI techniques: The system will leverage techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to analyze recipe descriptions, collaborative filtering to recommend recipes based on user preferences, and possibly machine learning algorithms for personalized recommendations.

## Challenges

*Ingredient availability: Ensuring the availability of ingredients for recommended recipes based on the user's location or specific dietary restrictions.

*Personalization: Creating accurate and personalized recommendations based on individual preferences and nutritional requirements.

*User feedback: Incorporating user feedback and continuously improving the recommendation system based on user interactions.

## What next?

*Recipe integration: Expand the system to include a vast collection of recipes from various sources and continually update the recipe database.

*User engagement: Enhance the user experience by allowing users to save favorite recipes, provide ratings, and share their own recipes within the community.

*Integration with smart kitchen appliances: Enable integration with smart kitchen devices to provide step-by-step cooking instructions and facilitate meal preparation.
